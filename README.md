# Social Media Site

## Description
This project is a small social media website prototype built using React.js, Redux, Node.js, and MongoDB. It provides basic functionality for user authentication, profile management, connections, and messaging, allowing users to sign up, log in, create profiles, connect with other users, and communicate via messages.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up for an account or log in with their credentials to access the platform.
- **Profile Management**: Users can create and edit their profiles, including adding personal information, profile pictures, and other details.
- **Connections**: Users can connect with other users by sending friend requests and accepting or rejecting incoming requests.
- **Messaging**: Users can send messages to their connections and view their message history within the platform.
- **Responsive Design**: The platform is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Redux State Management**: Redux is used for state management, providing a predictable and centralized store for managing application state.
- **Routing with React Router**: React Router is used for client-side routing, enabling navigation between different pages and components within the application.
